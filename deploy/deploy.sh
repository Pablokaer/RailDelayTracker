# Production deploy of IERailMetrics on the VPS (see docs/deploy.md).
#
#   deploy.sh [<commit sha>]  < irishrail.jar
#
# Run by GitHub Actions over SSH after the build passes on main. The jar is built and tested on the
# runner and streamed in on stdin, so the server needs neither Maven nor a clone of the repository.
# The deploy key in authorized_keys is restricted to this script (forced command), so the commit it
# was built from arrives in SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND and is only used to name the release.
#
# Steps: store the jar under releases/, point current.jar at it, restart the systemd service and wait
# until the actuator health endpoint answers. If the new version is not healthy, current.jar is put
# back on the previous release, the service is restarted and the script fails. Secrets live in the
# service's EnvironmentFile and are never touched.
#
# Overridable for tests: APP_DIR, SERVICE, LOG_FILE, HEALTH_URL, HEALTH_RETRIES, HEALTH_INTERVAL, KEEP_RELEASES.
